#                                 stays green, but the bug is documented.
# With bug_id IN known-bugs.txt AND body_pattern given AND mismatch:
#                                 body must match body_pattern (grep -q).

#                                 the error is unrelated to the known bug,
#                                 likely a regression in a different code path.
# With bug_id NOT in known-bugs.txt and mismatch:
#                                 loud FAIL (red) prompting test update —
#                                 the bug was fixed but the test still
#                                 asserts the old (broken) behaviour, OR
#                                 the bug ID needs to be added to
#                                 known-bugs.txt because it's a new issue.
# Returns 0 on pass, 1 on any kind of fail.
